# ðŸ“š Review With Students:
# Authentication vs Authorization
# Cookies vs Sessions
# How Flask Encrypts Sessions

# Set up:
# cd into server and run the following in the Terminal:
# export FLASK_APP=app.py
# export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5000
# flask db init
# flask db revision --autogenerate -m'Create tables'
# flask db upgrade
# python seed.py
# cd into client and run `npm i`

# Running React together
# In Terminal cd into the root directory, run:
# `honcho start -f Procfile.dev`

""" 
    Both of the Auths

    Authentication:
    - Validating a user to be who they claim
    - Ex: Getting your hand stamped at a bar/club

    Session:
    - Active time while the user is logged into the app
    - a series of activities that the user does
    - Potentinally Encrpyted Object that holds data

    Cookie:
    - Piece of data stored within the browser
    - Mostly used for (and for this lectures purposes) credentials and keeping a user signed in

    Authorization:
    - Level of access that a user can have
    - Ex: Checking the id, make sure you have access
    - This is where the passwords come into play
